## 1. Using different "languages" to improve and grow, being generalist

* WHat is a language ? Or a discipline ? Information, ideas and thoughts are abstract and they can be expressed or presented in various ways, like a language, a notation, a paradim, which allows you to process the information in a different lens/frame. These "translations" between languages/ notations/paradigms forces your brain to reflect and clarify, allowing for your understanding to mature furthr.
  * Natural languages was created to be versitale in communication, then men kind create other languages to niche or specific fields, or, to just reframe or use another lens to look at the same thing.
    * Think of systems thinking, which is a visual notation language, givin another angle again.
  * Every type of language allows you to express an idea differently, and some languages help to reason more efficiently through the nature of that problem.
  * Converting an idea between languages also create a challenge that forces you to better understand the idea again.
  * The different languages (or lenses/framings) gives a wider range to look at a problem, allowing more creative ways to understand and find even solutions to a problem.

* About lazyness, not starting, overthinking, not moving, don’t do at work. Work is a balancing act between “just start” and “plan accordingly”, sometimes needing to switch to the extreme opposites. With kids it feels that you just know you don't know the whole road, and you (or I) overplan less.
