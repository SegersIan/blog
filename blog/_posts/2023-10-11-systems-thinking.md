## Notes

### Systems Thinking Basics

> A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something

Definition of the book.

Notice 3 kind of things
* Elements
* Interconnections
* Function/Purpose
* [Personal addition]: Results in characteristics/behaviour of the system

The notation
* Stock: Elements that can be quantified
* Flow: An interconnection between 2 elements.
    * A flow is usually a verb/activity/event
    * A flow either "increases" downstream stock or else "increases" a downstream stock
* [Personal Addtion-ish]: Behaviours/dynamics
    * Feedback Loop
        * Balancing Feedback Loop
        * Reinforcing Feedback Loop
    * IF A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?

#### Conclusion

We can focus on the basics of Systems thinking, and then draw the simalarities across all the examples of "systems". OR/AND we can conclude/dive into the ways to study the behaviour of a system.
